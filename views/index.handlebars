        <h4>Specialized Funding for Students with Disabilities</h4>

        <p>Did you know that students with disabilities may be eligible for specialized funding? In addition to grants and bursaries,
          eligible students can also access financial support for additional services and equipment to support their disability
          related needs during their post-secondary experience.</p>
        <p>This session reviews all eligibility requirements for such funding, the application process, as well as the necessary
          timelines that will need to be met to ensure funding is approved and efficiently received.</p>



        <h4>Assistive Technology at Post-Secondary</h4>

        <p>Disabilities can create particular challenges at school and can impact specific academic responsibilities including
          reading, writing, math, and time management. Fortunately, there can be easy technological solutions and specialized
          equipment to help manage some of these more challenging demands. However, a fundamental part of effectively integrating
          these assistive tools is to identify available options and become familiar with their use before the first day
          of class. This session examines assistive technology and equipment that are specifically designed to address unique
          learning styles. The session will also review programs that can provide the equipment free of charge for eligible
          students.
        </p>


        <h4>Coaching and Advocacy</h4>

        <p>Some students can face particular challenges with organization, time management and feelings of becoming overwhelmed
          as they are confronted with the pressure and pace of post-secondary school. This can be particularly challenging
          for students who are transitioning from high school where they were provided with support staff and who assisted
          them with these particular learning needs. The Coaching and Advocacy session will review the benefits of an Academic
          Strategist and how they work with students with disabilities to manage the various challenges of studying at higher
          education. Funding options for such services may also be available and will be reviewed during this session.</p>


        <h4>Checklist before the First Day</h4>

        <p>There are simple steps that a student can take to make sure they’re set up for success before the first day of school.
          This session covers a variety of useful and easy things to do to help a student start classes with confidence.</p>


        <h4>Disability at Work – Employment Accommodations</h4>

        <p>What’s the plan after school is complete? Will there be a need for supports or accommodations at the future workplace?
          Where can a graduate go to access them and how could this impact their job opportunities? This session reviews
          what accommodations can look like in the work force as well as community resources that help job seekers with disabilities
          connect with employers.
